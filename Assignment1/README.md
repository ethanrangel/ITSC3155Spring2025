This assignment has two parts.

Part1 (40 points)

As part of this assignment, we will create a Ham Sandwich Maker Machine using interactive Python terminal. An automatic ham sandwich maker uses a set of programmed ingredients to make sandwiches. First, users select the size of the sandwich, then the machine determines how much resources are available before making it. The user receives a message if there are insufficient resources. Otherwise, the user must pay for sandwich by coins. The machine will indicate if insufficient coins are inserted or if there is an exchange amount when coins are inserted. Also, on the screen, users can view the remaining resources report and turn off the machine.
